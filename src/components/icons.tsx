/**
 * The app's icon set, in one place.
 *
 * Every glyph is Phosphor, exported under the name the codebase already used for it. The
 * indirection earns its keep three ways: the whole set can be swapped again by editing one file,
 * nothing else in the app has to know which library is behind a name, and the two places where a
 * single Lucide icon has no exact Phosphor twin are decided here rather than argued over in
 * twenty components.
 *
 * Sizing stays with the caller. Phosphor renders at `1em` by default, so the `w-4 h-4` classes
 * the components already pass keep working untouched — CSS beats the SVG's own attributes.
 *
 * Weights are Phosphor's real advantage over a single-weight set: a selected tool can thicken
 * rather than only change colour. `regular` is the default here; pass `weight="bold"` or
 * `weight="duotone"` where a state needs to read at a glance.
